# BooleanML
"Framework" for Neural Network creation. Uses tensorflow and keras to create models from csv files to predicct boolean values. Can predict in batches and / or from an array.
Keras models can be saved as a ".keras" file and loaded in to the python script from a directory.

## Libraries
~ Tensor Flow
~ Keras
~ Numpy
~ Visual Keras

## Jupyter notebook
[Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lFzAbOw6OzgRXSwdk1J8qHN-xXPFKV4m?usp=sharing)
The notebook contains the class as well as multipel examples of its usecases and syntax.

## Features
~ Layer definition of nodes
~ Batch prediction from csv files
~ Prediction from arrays
~ Accuracy + Loss evaluation
~ Visualistaion / Summarisation of models
~ Saving / Loading from memory

## Assets
Find datasets used in the github folder "Assets". All csv files have been modified from the originals that have been sourced from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/).
