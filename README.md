# BooleanML
"Framework" for Neural Network creation. Uses tensorflow and keras to create models from csv files to predicct boolean values. Can predict in batches and / or from an array.
Keras models can be saved as a ".keras" file and loaded in to the python script from a directory. Predicts boolean True or False values directly from CSV files

## Libraries
~ Tensor Flow

~ Keras

~ Numpy

~ Visual Keras


## Jupyter notebook
The [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lFzAbOw6OzgRXSwdk1J8qHN-xXPFKV4m?usp=sharing) contains the class as well as multipel examples of its usecases and syntax.
