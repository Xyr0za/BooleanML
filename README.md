# BooleanML
"Framework" for Neural Network creation. Uses tensorflow and keras to create models from csv files to predicct boolean values. Can predict in batches and / or from an array.
Keras models can be saved as a ".keras" file and loaded in to the python script from a directory.

## Libraries
~ Tensor Flow

~ Keras

~ Numpy

~ Visual Keras


## Jupyter notebook
The [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lFzAbOw6OzgRXSwdk1J8qHN-xXPFKV4m?usp=sharing) contains the class as well as multipel examples of its usecases and syntax.

## Features
~ Layer definition of nodes
~ Batch prediction from csv files
~ Prediction from arrays
~ Accuracy + Loss evaluation
~ Visualistaion / Summarisation of models
~ Saving / Loading from memory

## Assets
Find datasets used in the github folder "Assets". All csv files have been modified from the originals that have been sourced from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/).

This is the base showcase of the build_bsae() fucntion, with the output layer running a sigmoid function to return the booleans.
